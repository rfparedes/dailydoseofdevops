### Design a system to distribute a Linux kernel patch to thousands of servers

#### Key Points to Cover:

- **Centralized Patch Management**: Utilize a centralized patch management system like Red Hat Satellite, Spacewalk, or an open-source solution such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet.
- **Phased Rollout**: Implement a phased rollout strategy to minimize risk. Start with a small subset of servers, then gradually increase the rollout size after confirming stability.
- **Automation and Orchestration**: Use automation tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef) to script the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring (using tools like Nagios, Prometheus) and logging (e.g., ELK stack) to track the progress and detect issues in real-time.
- **Rollback Plan**: Develop a rollback plan in case the patch causes unexpected issues, using version control and backup strategies.

#### Example Response:

"I would design a system using a centralized patch management tool like Ansible for automation. The patch distribution would follow a phased rollout approach, starting with a small group of non-critical servers, then expanding gradually. Automation scripts would ensure consistent application across all servers, with detailed logging and monitoring to track progress and catch any issues early. A robust rollback plan would be in place, utilizing backups and version control to revert changes if necessary."

### Design a system to centralize web server logs into a (few) servers, possibly running OLAP type queries

#### Key Points to Cover:

- **Centralized Logging**: Use a centralized logging solution like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog.
- **Log Aggregation**: Set up log shippers (e.g., Filebeat, Logstash) on web servers to send logs to the central log servers.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the central log servers are scalable and capable of handling high volumes of log data.
- **OLAP Integration**: Integrate OLAP tools like Apache Druid or ClickHouse with the centralized logging system to run complex queries and analytics.
- **Data Retention and Archival**: Implement policies for log retention and archival to manage storage efficiently.

#### Example Response:

"For centralizing web server logs, I would use the ELK stack for log aggregation and visualization. Log shippers like Filebeat would be deployed on each web server to send logs to Elasticsearch clusters. To run OLAP queries, I would integrate Elasticsearch with OLAP tools like Apache Druid, enabling efficient querying and analytics. Additionally, I'd establish data retention policies to manage storage and archival, ensuring long-term log availability and performance."

### Design a website that sells one product with very high traffic in a short amount of time (e.g., a promo in a Super Bowl commercial)

#### Key Points to Cover:

- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Use a cloud provider like AWS for scalable infrastructure, leveraging auto-scaling groups and load balancers.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use a CDN (e.g., CloudFront) to distribute traffic and reduce load on origin servers.
- **Database Scaling**: Implement a highly scalable database solution (e.g., Amazon RDS with read replicas or DynamoDB).
- **Caching**: Utilize caching mechanisms (e.g., Amazon ElastiCache) to reduce database load.
- **Performance Testing**: Conduct extensive load testing using tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to ensure the system can handle peak traffic.
- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Design for high availability using multiple availability zones and regions to avoid single points of failure.

#### Example Response:

"To handle high traffic for a promo during a Super Bowl commercial, I'd design a system using AWS with auto-scaling groups and load balancers to dynamically handle traffic surges. A CDN like CloudFront would distribute content globally, reducing load on the origin servers. The database layer would use Amazon RDS with read replicas or DynamoDB for scalability. Caching with ElastiCache would further reduce database load. Extensive load testing would ensure the system's capability to handle peak traffic. Additionally, the architecture would be highly available, leveraging multiple availability zones and regions to ensure fault tolerance."
