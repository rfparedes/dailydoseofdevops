# Interview Questions

## Design

### Design a system to distribute a Linux kernel patch to thousands of servers

#### Key Points to Cover:

- **Centralized Patch Management**: Utilize a centralized patch management system like Red Hat Satellite, Spacewalk, or an open-source solution such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet.
- **Phased Rollout**: Implement a phased rollout strategy to minimize risk. Start with a small subset of servers, then gradually increase the rollout size after confirming stability.
- **Automation and Orchestration**: Use automation tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef) to script the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring (using tools like Nagios, Prometheus) and logging (e.g., ELK stack) to track the progress and detect issues in real-time.
- **Rollback Plan**: Develop a rollback plan in case the patch causes unexpected issues, using version control and backup strategies.

#### Example Response:

"I would design a system using a centralized patch management tool like Ansible for automation. The patch distribution would follow a phased rollout approach, starting with a small group of non-critical servers, then expanding gradually. Automation scripts would ensure consistent application across all servers, with detailed logging and monitoring to track progress and catch any issues early. A robust rollback plan would be in place, utilizing backups and version control to revert changes if necessary."
